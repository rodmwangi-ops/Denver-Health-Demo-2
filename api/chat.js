      content: `Having a clear set of norms can build trust among participants by making sure that everyone feels that they will be heard, that attention is paid to inclusive behavior and that there is space and time for questions and contributions from all participants.

Norms can help encourage reflection on ones own understanding and on others' ideas. They can facilitate productive communication among group members. They also define a common ground for communication, regardless of the differences among the group.

Leadership norms

Leadership norms are a set of rules or operating principles that shape team members' interactions.

They establish clear, agreed-upon behavior, how the work will get done, and what team members can expect of each other.

Having a set of norms that a team consistently follows:

- Helps team members be clearer about each other's intentions  
- Increases trust  
- Saves time  
- Decreases backbiting and politics  
- Sets a clear operational compass for the rest of the organization

Five Dysfunctions of a Team

[IMAGE: Pyramid diagram showing five dysfunctions from bottom to top]

Inattention to results

Increases the likelihood that individual ego or silos will be more important than collective team results

Avoid accountability

Individuals hesitate to call their peers on counterproductive actions and behaviors if they believe those actions and behaviors were never agreed upon

Lack of commitment

Difficult to truly commit to decisions they don't feel that they are part of

Fear of conflict

Unlikely to engage in passionate debate; increasing the likelihood of sub-optimal decisions

Loss of trust

Reluctant to be vulnerable with one another, unwilling to admit mistakes

ADAPTED FROM A MODEL BY PATRICK LENCIONI

Using the Denver Health leadership norms can build healthier teams. Norms help us create strong and trusting relationships because we know what is expected of each other, fostering stability and consistency. They give us a common language of expected behaviors for our leaders, driving accountability in decision making and our actions.

      type: "procedure",
      tags: ["Leadership Norms", "Leader", "Accountability", "Professional Behavior"],
      content: `Making norms apply to yourself, especially in a professional setting like health care, involves internalizing and consistently adhering to the established standards and expectations. Here are some steps you can take to ensure that you embody the norms in your daily work:

1. UNDERSTAND THE NORMS

Familiarize yourself: Take the time to thoroughly understand the norms, guidelines, and expectations that are in place within Denver Health. This includes knowing the ethical standards, operational procedures, and professional conduct expected of you.

Seek clarification: If any norms are unclear, ask for clarification from supervisors, colleagues or your HR Business Partner. It's important to fully grasp what is expected to ensure compliance.

2. ALIGN WITH PERSONAL VALUES

Self-reflection: Reflect on how the norms align with your own values and principles. When norms resonate with your personal values, it's easier to commit to them.

Integrate norms into daily practice: Make a conscious effort to align your daily actions, decisions and interactions with the established norms. This could include how you communicate, handle patient care, or collaborate with colleagues.

3. CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND ADAPTATION

Ongoing training: Participate in any training or professional development opportunities that reinforce the norms, such as workshops on ethical practices, communication skills or cultural competence.

Stay updated: Health care norms can evolve with new regulations, technology and best practices. Keep yourself informed about any changes and adapt accordingly.

4. MODEL THE NORMS

Lead by example: Whether you're in a leadership role or not, strive to model the norms in your behavior. This includes being punctual and respectful and adhering to protocols.

Mentorship: If possible, mentor others by sharing your understanding and adherence to norms. This reinforces your own commitment and helps create a culture of compliance.

5. HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE

Self-monitoring: Regularly assess your own behavior and performance against the norms. Ask yourself if you're consistently meeting the standards set by Denver Health.

Seek feedback: Invite feedback from peers, supervisors or even patients to gain an outside perspective on how well you're adhering to the norms. Use this feedback to make improvements where needed.

6. INTEGRATE NORMS INTO DECISION-MAKING

Ethical decision-making: When faced with decisions, especially difficult ones, consciously apply the norms as a framework for making choices. Consider the impact of your decisions on patients, colleagues and Denver Health.

Consistency: Ensure that your decisions are consistent with the established norms, regardless of the situation. This builds trust and integrity in your professional role.

7. COMMIT TO PERSONAL INTEGRITY

Internal motivation: Develop an internal motivation to follow the norms, rather than relying solely on external enforcement. When you believe in the importance of the norms, adherence becomes part of your professional identity.

Ethical resilience: In challenging situations, where it might be easier to deviate from the norms, remind yourself of the long-term importance of maintaining ethical and professional standards.

8. CONTRIBUTE TO NORM DEVELOPMENT

Active participation: If Denver Health is developing or revising norms, actively participate in discussions. Your insights can help shape norms that are realistic and effective

Feedback loop: Provide constructive feedback on existing norms based on your experience. This helps ensure that the norms are practical and applicable in real-world scenarios.

9. REWARD YOURSELF

Recognize adherence: Acknowledge your efforts when you successfully adhere to the norms, especially in difficult situations. This self-recognition can motivate continued compliance.

Set personal goals: Set goals related to norm adherence and reward yourself when you achieve them. For example, aim to improve your communication skills in line with Denver Health norms and celebrate when you see progress.

By making these efforts, you can ensure that the norms become an integral part of your professional behavior, contributing to your success and the overall success of Denver Health.

Recognition: Recognize and reward those individuals and teams who exemplify the norms, reinforcing the importance within Denver Health.

      type: "procedure",
      tags: ["Leadership Norms", "Icebreaker", "Facilitation"],
      content: `1. PREPARATION:

Create bingo cards: Design bingo cards with a 5x5 grid. Each square should contain a statement or question related to one of the four leadership norms: alignment, accountability, teamwork and respect. Here are some examples:

"Share an example of when you aligned your team toward a common goal."

"Describe a time you held yourself accountable for a mistake."

"Talk about a successful team project you were part of."

"Give an example of how you show respect to colleagues in meetings."

"Find someone who believes in giving credit where it's due."

"Find someone who regularly checks in with their team to ensure alignment."

"Share a situation where mutual respect led to a positive outcome."

"Talk about how you encourage teamwork in your department."

"Find someone who regularly seeks feedback for personal accountability."

Distribute cards: Give each participant a bingo card and a pen/marker as they arrive.

2. INSTRUCTIONS:

Explain the icebreaker: Let participants know they will be playing "Leadership Norms bingo." Their goal is to mingle and find people who match the descriptions in the squares on their bingo card.

How to play: When they find someone who fits a description, they should write that person's name in the corresponding square. Participants can only use each person's name once on their card.

Winning: The first person to complete a row, column or diagonal shouts "Bingo!" and wins. Depending on the group size, you can continue until you have multiple winners or until time runs out.

3. PLAY THE GAME (10-15 MINUTES):

Mingle: Allow participants to move around the room, introduce themselves and ask questions to fill in their bingo cards. Encourage them to discuss the norms as they go to deepen the conversation.

Monitor and engage: Walk around to help participants if needed, and encourage them to share more than just short answers.

4. DEBRIEF AND DISCUSSION (5-10 MINUTES):

Share experiences: Once the game ends, gather everyone together and ask a few participants to share interesting examples or stories they heard during the activity.

Connect to leadership norms: Briefly discuss how the stories shared during the bingo game relate to the importance of alignment, accountability, teamwork and respect in leadership.

5. CLOSING:

Recognize winners: If using prizes, hand them out to the winners. Otherwise, simply acknowledge their achievement.

Encourage reflection: Conclude by encouraging participants to think about how they can bring these leadership norms into their daily work.

This icebreaker is a fun way to initiate meaningful conversations around key leadership norms while allowing participants to connect with each other on a personal and professional level.

We are approaching engagement in an exciting way at Denver Health. The Your Voice, Our Vision engagement survey will allow for employee voice with the goal of improving Denver Health. As a teaching hospital, we are committed to improvement, innovation, and fostering a culture of continuous growth, collaboration and belonging. The results will enable you, as a leader, to identify what is working and pinpoint areas for improvement. Utilizing this guide will help you consider how to effectively communicate results and navigate feedback conversations with your team. As leaders, it is our responsibility to communicate clearly on what the results were and allow space for the team to digest, process, and collaborate on the information shared.

This guide is designed to assist you in understanding your team's engagement survey results, how to share them with your team, and consider strategies for improving your employee's experience at Denver Health. In addition to the employee engagement survey administered quarterly, targeted Pulse surveys will be offered quarterly moving forward. The survey will allow you the opportunity to assess results over time and consider the best strategies to implement.

This survey will ask employees to respond to questions in the following areas:

Engagement

Diversity (Belonging)

Health and well-being

Transformation and change

Safety

Trust

The Your Voice, Our Vision tool creates recommendations for leadership next steps. Use these ideas as jumping off points for discussion as well as your own development items.

      content: `This data will give you critical insight into your team's experience. There will likely be a mix of positive and constructive feedback and will include some information you may have expected as well as some feedback that was unexpected. We don't always have full awareness of the day-to-day experiences of our employees and can't act on things we don't know about, so we invite you to be mindful of this as you read and digest your team's feedback.

It will be important to recognize and celebrate areas where employees have expressed satisfaction. As you prepare to share this with your team, build on that feedback by communicating your wins and reinforce what is working well. Positive feedback can be used as a foundation to build upon and strengthen other areas. Effectively sharing and communicating engagement score results with your team is crucial for fostering trust and encouraging collective efforts toward improvement. It helps build a culture that encompasses Denver Health's values of respect, belonging, transparency and accountability.

Communicate with your employees to let them know their feedback has been received and is valued. You could share statements like:

Your feedback helps us build a workplace where everyone feels valued and empowered.

Your voice is critically important to help us understand how we can create an environment where your experiences and expertise can be seen and heard.

You deliver more than an outcome to Denver Health, our patients, our community and even our team. By showing up as yourself, you make us better.

We appreciate your honest feedback and are committed to making continual improvements.

If you come across any feedback you were not expecting, you may experience heightened emotions. It can be challenging to read unexpected feedback. Do your best to read the responses with an open mind. We want to encourage our employees to be honest, and that requires us to be open-minded.

If you need support in understanding your results, reach out to your leader and your HR Business Partner to talk through your results and consider some personalized strategies for sharing data with your team.

Steps to take

Call your HR Business Partner to process your results and consider strategy for sharing with your team

Schedule a time to debrief with your team

What to avoid

Reaching out to team members to vent about your results

Questioning your results

One of our goals at Denver Health is to normalize feedback as part of the employee experience, and that is true for employees at all levels. It can be scary to share feedback with a leader who is in a position of power, and the confidentiality of this survey might allow an employee to share their experience more openly. How we respond to and share this feedback can be a catalyst in helping an employee feel seen, heard and supported. Later in the guide, you will see some strategies for sharing your results with your team and having conversations with your employees.

      tags: ["Engagement", "Survey Results", "Leader", "HRBP"],
      content: `You may be a person who loves data and wants to use all the Your Voice, Our Vision survey tools to compare the information you receive. Consider the following action steps as you digest your results:

Step 1: Consider your team's participation

What was your team's participation in the survey? Starting here allows us to create some context to view the rest of the results. As a reminder, our goal at Denver Health is a 75% response rate. Ideally, we'd love for this number to be 100% but know many things may affect an employee's response; they may be on PTO during the survey window or choose not to take the survey.

If your response rates are lower on this first survey, remind the team that we can only act on the feedback that is received. Remind your team that the feedback is strictly confidential. If your survey participation rates do not improve over time, work closely with your HR Business Partner and leadership team to create strategies to build trust within your team. As Denver Health continues to administer this survey and you start to act by utilizing your results to inform decisions and change, employees will see that commitment. Ideally, that will help response rates go up on your team.

Step 2: Review your engagement score

Look at your engagement score and consider the following:

Where is your team successful?

Where is the team in line with organizational scores?

Where is there opportunity to do better?

It can be helpful to engage your HR Business Partner and your leader to understand and explore your engagement score.

Step 3: Look at emerging themes

As you review your data, start to look at trends across answers. For example, you may notice your team rated significantly lower scores in the health and well-being question set. Or, you might see employees share they have struggled with finding community at Denver Health and have low scores in Belonging. What do you do with this information?

We encourage you to work with your leadership team and your HR Business Partner on reviewing themes in your service area or unit. What might the team notice that could help you understand the scores differently? It is not an expectation that you will solve every issue that emerges immediately. Consider some of the low hanging fruit or easy changes and how you might be able to take some immediate action steps prior to the next engagement survey. Here are some ideas to consider when reading through your results and looking at themes:

What is there to celebrate?

What are you curious about?

Select one area to focus on: Engagement, Diversity (Belonging), Health and Well-Being, Transformation and Change, Safety or Trust

Focus on one or two quick wins and one longer-term action over the next quarter.

Focusing on 1-2 areas will effect change. When you focus on too many areas, there is often little to no change in the results.

The tool will make recommendations on what to prioritize. Use these recommendations to guide your work with your team.

Next, consider the different learning styles and needs of your team. Would a slide deck showing some of the high-level results be helpful? Would the team respond better to an overview of the dashboard and data? You might need a mix of both. Depending on the size and scheduling needs of your team, you may need more than one meeting to share the results and invite conversation.

You can export dashboard results into a PowerPoint presentation by clicking the export button on your dashboard overview. The export displays results from the dashboard of the question set you're viewing. It's possible to export a PowerPoint for Engagement, Diversity & Inclusion, and Health & Well-being question sets.

The engagement tool suggests various engagement drivers as focus areas based on each team's survey results. Leaders can accept recommended focus areas or set their own focus areas. Discuss the suggested focus areas with your team and solicit feedback on what focus area(s) they want to address. Team suggestions can help gain further insights on drivers to understand underlying concerns. Leaders should identify one to two focus areas for action planning.

What is an action step we could take right now?

After they have written down their thoughts, invite them to place their sticky notes with the corresponding prompt and encourage everyone to walk through and read the responses. Then, break up the team into three small groups and assign them to one of the prompts. Encourage the group to read through all of the responses and see if there are any themes or overlapping ideas. They might group all similar responses together to share out with the larger group.

As each small group shares out, open it up for responses or follow up questions. It is recommended to take notes or ask someone to do so to ensure you are capturing what the team is sharing. After each group has shared, steer the conversation to action steps. Some questions you might ask include:

What are the immediate areas we could act on? What is the low hanging fruit or quick change?

What might take longer or need more time to process?

Were there any perspectives missing or that we didn't consider in this conversation?

As you close the conversation, share your process for next steps and remind the group that you will keep them up to date.

      content: `This activity or sharing the data may lead to some challenging or tense moments with the team. As a leader, how you set up the space and model a respectful conversation can be paramount in the team responding well. We don't want to shy away from conflict, but we do want to create an environment where everyone feels they can speak and share openly and without repercussions. We encourage you to set some ground rules and expectations for the conversation. Some rules and norms might include:

Utilize Denver Health's value definitions of Respect, Transparency, Accountability and Belonging. Understanding and diving into this data as a team is an exercise in our values. (Definitions can be found on the Pulse: Values Definitions - PDF.pdf (dhha.org))

Encouraging a meeting norm of using I statements and asking team members to speak for themselves. We cannot speak on behalf of entire groups, nor do we want to minimize the voices or experiences of others, so challenge the team to use I statements instead of we or you statements. For example, this might sound like, "I feel excited about our belonging scores and am curious how we might be able to advance this even further."

Remind the team that conflict and discomfort are often part of growth.

Name that it is not the goal of the session or the survey to find out who said what but rather to focus on what was shared, what we can learn from it and how we take action toward changing culture.

Ensure each team member has an opportunity to comment as you work through the feedback. Communities and teams are built and strengthened by centering trust. Trust in the voices of your colleagues and their commitment to the conversation. Remember that all team members may not agree with the engagement score results as reflective of their work experience. As a leader, we can remind our teams that more than one reality exists.

Practice active listening and listening to hear, not just listening to respond. Consider the context and the content.

Trust the intentions of your colleagues and be accountable for your impact.

Invite others into the conversation - notice group dynamics and share airtime.

Ask the team what else they might need.

If you do encounter tension or frustration during the conversation, it is OK to pause and consider what you need as well as what the team needs. If it makes sense to continue the conversation, perhaps take a short stretch/bio break and allow the team to move around a bit. If you are not feeling that it would be appropriate to continue, press the pause button. Share with the group that you will revisit the conversation at your next team meeting or set a different time to continue. Consider creating an ask for the team to help prepare for the next conversation, such as thinking about which norm they want to focus on, or one area that felt incomplete that they'd like to see addressed in the next session. Follow up quickly with that date and time after the meeting.

There may also be additional conversations or repair work needed. Check in individually with employees as to how they felt the session went and what they might need in the space if they were upset or triggered. Don't hesitate to connect them to resources like RESTORE Peer Support. You may want to schedule some time with your HR Business Partner to check in on the meeting and talk through strategies for your next session.

Leaders can create action plans using recommended actions by Peakon or creating custom actions created by leaders themselves. Peakon provides a library of recommended actions that display on the Improve tab of each driver, or when you take a micro course related to a specific driver.

To ensure that changes are made and not just talked about, each step of your action plan should have an owner and a completion date. Sometimes, that owner may be the whole team. Ideally, an action plan will include:

Specific changes the team is committing to

Who is responsible for the implementation

Timelines and due dates for implementing the changes

Dates for submitting progress reports

How success will be measured

What follow up looks like

When a leader creates an action plan, they can choose to share the action plan which provides visibility on the employee personal dashboards. Leaders are highly encouraged to share their action plans to promote trust, transparency and accountability, in line with Denver Health's values.

Share this action plan with the team and encourage participation across all levels.

- Employees on leave should remain available during their regularly scheduled shift should they need to be contacted.

- Employees on administrative leave may not take on another job that is during the hours of their regularly scheduled DHHA employment.

Manager: "Administrative leave is necessary to ensure that a thorough and complete investigation can take place. This is a standard procedure for all allegations of this nature. Leave is not punitive and protects you and the organization. Leave will allow the Investigators to maintain the integrity of the investigation."

Employee: "You don't think I did anything wrong, right?"

Manager: "Administrative leave is not indicative of whether or not I think the allegations are true, but rather a procedure that is put in place to ensure that the organization can thoroughly look evaluate the patient's concerns."

Employee: "How long will this take and will I be paid for this time?"

Manager: "An investigation typically takes 3-5 business days. You will not be paid while you are out on leave. If claims associated with the investigation are unsubstantiated, you will be paid at your base pay rate for any missed regularly scheduled shifts."

Employee: "Does this go into my employee file?"

Manager: "Allegations that are unsubstantiated are not part of your Denver Health HR employee record. Disciplinary action issued based on a substantiation of the allegations will be captured in your employee record."

Employee: "Am I being fired?"

Manager: "At this time, you are just out on administrative leave while an investigation takes place. Leave is not punitive and does not imply that the organization believes something did or did not occur."

Employee: "Who will be in touch with me while I am out on leave to update me on the investigation?"

Manager: "I will be in contact with you every two days or so to check-in with you. I won't be able to discuss specifics about the investigation, as I likely will not be privy to that information either. However, I will make sure that I am in contact with you so that you know that things are moving along."

Employee: "What will you tell my coworkers? What should I tell them?"

Manager: "I will simply tell the team that you will be out for the next few days. I will maintain confidentiality and ask that you do the same. Please do not communicate with your coworkers about the investigation."

Total rewards is so much more than an employee's compensation and benefits. These two items are the foundation and critical to attract and retain talented employees. Denver Health benchmarks pay and benefits every year to ensure we remain competitive in the market and aligned with our compensation philosophy. However, what makes Denver Health unique and different than other employers is our focus on ensuring every individual understands how their role/work affects our vision, mission and strategic plan.

As leaders, you are the person who has the greatest ability to shape this experience for your staff. Helping them connect to their purpose for working at Denver Health and consistently staying connected to that purpose is critical. Equally important is ensuring regular and engaging conversations that allow you to understand each employee's career goals, areas for development/learning and resources that support their physical, mental/emotional and financial well-being. This guide is focused on supporting specific conversations around pay and how pay works at Denver Health so every leader can regularly and confidently talk about pay with their employees.

      content: `Denver Health's compensation is determined based on a comprehensive system guided by the DH compensation philosophy that includes job descriptions, market surveys, salary grades and pay structures.

When you think about compensation, you think about pay. While that is correct, we don't start there; we end there. There is a process that guides and informs how we establish the pay rates for individuals. You can see here that process outlined to determine an individual pay rate.

1. JOB ANALYSIS

The process of gathering all there is to know about a job. This can be accomplished through questionnaires, structured interviews, observation, etc.

2. JOB DOCUMENTATION

A summary of the job's essential functions, minimum qualifications, experience, KSAs, working environment and physical requirements.

3. MARKET PRICING

An external look at the going pay (base and/or incentive) rates for jobs in the appropriate labor market.

4. JOB EVALUATION

The formal systematic process for determining relative worth (or comparable worth) of an organization's jobs. The job, not the employee is evaluated.

5. ESTABLISHING PAY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

Determing what to pay an employee based on steps 1-4 and what the individual "brings to the table" by way of background/experience.

The process begins with having correct and effective job descriptions, matching those jobs to the market, benchmarking and pricing them annually based on purchased and credible salary surveys, and determining the midpoint of each pay range or provider pay band.

From this, we may make decisions about changing the salary grade and pay band structure accordingly. Annual increases and market adjustments are determined each year by the Pay Steering Committee (CEO, COO, CHRO, CFO, HR Compensation – other leaders invited as needed) and are dependent on market survey data, financial position of Denver Health and highest priority/hardest-to-fill positions.

      tags: ["Compensation", "Employee Questions", "Leader"],
      content: `Why is my pay similar or less than someone with similar or less experience than me in the same job?

Pay is determined at the time of hire based on the pay grade of the job, peer equity and years of experience, given this is the only data point we have at the time of hire. Once someone is hired, their pay can change by one of the four pay changes listed above. It is possible for a new hire to come in higher than a current employee due to higher market demand. Denver Health Talent Acquisition and Compensation work with leaders for every offer to ensure equitable hiring practices to avoid discriminatory pay practices or creating substantial pay differences based on experience only. The annual processes of evaluating market data and pay equity ensure employees are paid competitively and fairly.

Where do I find my pay and benefits or total rewards information?

Workday features a total reward statement both employees and leaders have access to help understand the investment of base pay plus additional benefits – PTO, retirement, STD/LTD, and well-being. Click here for instructions to access the total reward statement for yourself and your employees. You should also become familiar with the Denver Health Benefits Guide to understand our comprehensive list of benefit offerings include our highly competitive medical plans and the up to 9.5% employer matching contributions through 401(a) and 457(b) retirement plans.

Who should I talk to about my pay at Denver Health?

Direct supervisors, managers, leaders should be the first point of contact for any pay-related questions. In fact, leaders should be having regular conversations with employees about pay, benefits, work, career goals, development areas and ensuring their employees are comfortable understanding their job, pay and benefits and learning/growth opportunities at Denver Health. Leaders should reach out to their HR Business Partner (HRBP) if they are unsure how to answer questions about pay or benefits. The HRBP can support them or connect them to a Compensation Partner or our Benefits team for additional help if needed. Leaders should avoid directing employees to Compensation for questions about their pay without having the conversation about their questions first. This experience gives the perception that their leader does not understand or is unable to support.

If my job description is not accurate who can help me?

Leaders should review the job description prior to creating any new position or posting any backfill position. Compensation can help guide the creation of job descriptions and leaders have access to the Compensation Essentials course to provide best practice and standard guidance for writing effective job descriptions. If an employee believes their job description is incorrect or inaccurate, they should have that discussion with their leader. HR Compensation Partners can help answer leaders' questions about job description creations and revisions.

Essential function – the job duties that an employee must be able to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation.

Pay (or salary) structure – the hierarchy of job grades and pay ranges established within an organization. Denver Health non-provider salary structure is expressed in terms of job grades with a minimum, midpoint and maximum pay rate. Provider pay structure is expressed in terms of pay bands by job/medical specialty area from 0-9 with 0 being the minimum and 9 being the maximum pay rate.

Compression – when differentials between adjacent job grades/incumbent pay rates become too small to be considered equitable.

Cost of living – the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses such as housing, food, taxes and health care in a certain place and time period.

Cost of labor - a measure of external pay practices where data on labor market costs (total compensation amounts) are obtained from labor market competitors and relied upon when establishing target cash compensation opportunity. It reflects a "cost to hire and retain" logic for setting target pay levels (pay grades and pay rates).

Transfers and promotions – please be familiar with this policy and the difference between transfers, promotions, in-line promotions and job reclassifications. Responsibilities of hiring leaders are also outlined in this policy.

Pay Steering Committee – CEO, CFO, COO, CHRO and HR Compensation (Legal and other SMEs over particular disciplines as needed) meet at least monthly to review and inform compensation policies and practices including decisions related to annual increases, market adjustments and pay equity.

Job Requisition Review Committee – Senior leaders from Finance, HR, Nursing and Operations meet at least weekly to review new job requisitions and job changes including guidance and approval on job change process workflows. Appropriate leaders are invited to discuss expansion requests or new jobs as needed.
